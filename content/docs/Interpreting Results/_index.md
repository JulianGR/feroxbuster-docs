  How to interpret the results displayed by feroxbuster 
---

`feroxbuster` attempts to be intuitive and easy to understand, however, if you are wondering about any of the scan's

### Discovered Resource

When `feroxbuster` finds a response that you haven't filtered out, it's reported above the progress bars and looks similar to what's pictured below.  

The number of lines, words, and bytes shown here can be used to [filter those responses](../examples/filter-word-line/)
