## Stop and Resume Scans

Version 1.9.0 adds a few features that allow for completely stopping a scan, and resuming that same scan from a file on
disk.

## Stop the scan 

A simple `Ctrl+C` during a scan will create a file that contains information about the scan that was cancelled.

![save-state](../save-state.png)

```json
// example snippet of state file

{
  "scans": [
    {
      "id": "ca21821164b44b3d8eaa76550577246c",
      "url": "https://localhost.com/",
      "normalized_url": "https://localhost.com/",
      "scan_type": "Directory",
      "status": "Running",
      "num_requests": 4714,
      "requests_made_so_far": 3468
    },
    {
      "id": "d65b59601117415abf9ce6c0aa69edc7",
      "url": "https://localhost.com/api/",
      "normalized_url": "https://localhost.com/api/",
      "scan_type": "Directory",
      "status": "Running",
      "num_requests": 4714,
      "requests_made_so_far": 2774
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "wordlist": "/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt",
    "...": "..."
  },
  "responses": [
    {
      "type": "response",
      "url": "https://localhost.com/Login",
      "path": "/Login",
      "wildcard": false,
      "status": 302,
      "content_length": 0,
      "line_count": 0,
      "word_count": 0,
      "headers": {
        "content-length": "0",
        "server": "nginx/1.16.1"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

## Resume the scan

Based on the example image above, the same scan can be resumed by
using `feroxbuster --resume-from ferox-http_localhost-1606947491.state`. Directories that were already complete are not
rescanned. 

(updated behavior for **2.8.0**) Partially complete scans are started from roughly where they left off. More specifically, 10% less than the number
of requests that were made already (`requests_made_so_far`) becomes the starting offset into the wordlist. This is to
help ensure that no responses were lost mid-flight when cancelling/resuming.

formula in pseudocode
```
wordlist_offset = requests_made_so_far - (requests_made_so_far * 0.10)
```

## Opt-out of saving state 

In order to prevent state file creation when `Ctrl+C` is pressed, you can simply add the entry below to
your `ferox-config.toml`.

```toml
# ferox-config.toml

save_state = false
```
