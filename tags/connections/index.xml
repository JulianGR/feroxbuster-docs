&lt;p>Limit the number of scans permitted to run at any given time. Recursion will still identify new directories, but newly
discovered directories can only begin scanning when the total number of active scans drops below the value passed to
&lt;code>--scan-limit&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

Rate limiting is enforced on a &lt;strong>per-directory&lt;/strong> basis.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Version 2.0.0 added the ability to limit the number of requests per second.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Limit number of requests per second, per directory, to 100 (requests per second will increase by 100 for each active directory found during recursion)&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>./feroxbuster -u http://localhost --rate-limit 100
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Limit number of requests per second to 100 to the target as a whole (only one directory at a time will be scanned, thus
limiting the number of requests per second overall)&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>./feroxbuster -u http://localhost --rate-limit 100 --scan-limit 1

&lt;p>The error in question can be boiled down to &amp;rsquo;networking stuff&amp;rsquo;. &lt;code>feroxbuster&lt;/code>
uses &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/">reqwest&lt;/a> which uses &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/">hyper&lt;/a> to make requests
to the server. &lt;a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2136#issuecomment-589345238">This issue report&lt;/a> to the hyper
project explains what is happening (quoted below to save you a click). This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug so much as it&amp;rsquo;s a
target-specific tuning issue. When lowering the &lt;code>-t&lt;/code> value, the error doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur (or happens much less frequently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug. Simply slow down the scan. A &lt;code>-t&lt;/code> value of 50 was chosen as a sane default that&amp;rsquo;s still quite fast out
of the box. However, network related errors may occur when the client and/or server become over-saturated.
The &lt;a href="../../configuration/limit-connections/">Threads and Connection Limits At A High-Level&lt;/a> section details how
to accomplish per-target tuning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is just due to the racy nature of networking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>hyper has a connection pool of idle connections, and it selected one to send your request. Most of the time, hyper will receive the server&amp;rsquo;s FIN and drop the dead connection from its pool. But occasionally, a connection will be selected from the pool and written to at the same time the server is deciding to close the connection. Since hyper already wrote some of the request, it can&amp;rsquo;t really retry it automatically on a new connection, since the server may have acted already.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="a-high-level-overview">A High-Level Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This section explains how the &lt;code>-t&lt;/code> and &lt;code>-L&lt;/code> options work together to determine the overall aggressiveness of a scan. The
combination of the two values set by these options determines how hard your target will get hit and to some extent also
determines how many resources will be consumed on your local machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-note-on-green-threads">A Note on Green Threads&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;code>feroxbuster&lt;/code> uses so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads&lt;/a> as opposed to traditional
kernel/OS threads. This means (at a high-level) that the threads are implemented entirely in userspace, within a single
running process. As a result, a scan with 30 green threads will appear to the OS to be a single process with no
additional light-weight processes associated with it as far as the kernel is concerned. As such, there will not be any
impact to process (&lt;code>nproc&lt;/code>) limits when specifying larger values for &lt;code>-t&lt;/code>. However, these threads will still consume
file descriptors, so you will need to ensure that you have a suitable &lt;code>nlimit&lt;/code> set when scaling up the amount of
threads. More detailed documentation on setting appropriate &lt;code>nlimit&lt;/code> values can be found in
the &lt;a href="../../faq/no-file-descriptors/">No File Descriptors Available&lt;/a> section of the FAQ&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Threads&lt;/strong>: The &lt;code>-t&lt;/code> option specifies the maximum amount of active threads &lt;em>per-directory&lt;/em> during a scan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Connection Limits&lt;/strong>: The &lt;code>-L&lt;/code> option specifies the maximum amount of active connections per thread&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To truly have only 30 active requests to a site at any given time, &lt;code>-t 30 -L 1&lt;/code> is necessary. Using &lt;code>-t 30 -L 2&lt;/code> will
result in a maximum of 60 total requests being processed at any given time for that site. And so on. For a conversation
on this, please see &lt;a href="https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/issues/126">Issue #126&lt;/a> which may provide more (or less)
clarity ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
