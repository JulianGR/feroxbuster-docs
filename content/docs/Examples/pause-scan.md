{{% alert title="Note" %}}
[v1.12.0](../cancel-scan/) added an interactive menu to the pause/resume
functionality.  

Active scans can still be paused, however, you'll be presented with the option to cancel a scan instead
of simply seeing a spinner.
{{% /alert %}}

## Pause an Active Scan

Scans can be paused and resumed by pressing the `ENTER` key (~~shown below~~, please see [v1.12.0](../cancel-scan/)'s entry for the latest visual representation)
